            <li>First, open Git Bash by rigth clicking inside of the folder and selecting Git Bash. You should get the following screen. <img src="images/gitbash.PNG"></img></li>
            <li>Next use the command for initilizing your code. This is: git init <img src="images/init.png"></li>
            <li>Then you must tell the program where to look for the information. This is done by using the command: git checkout -b gh-pages.</li>
            <li>Now is a good time to check the status of your files. This can be done by simply typing: git status
               <ul>
                <li>It is important to note a few things here:

                    <li>If you get the following screen, then all of your files are properly saved. <img src="images/cleanstatus.png"></li>
                    <li>If there are files that show up in red however, then these files will need to be commited. We will review this process in a moment.</li>
